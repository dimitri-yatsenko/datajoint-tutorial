## Metadata 

The term *metadata* has been used to two distinct ways.  In data science, metadata denotes information about the data such as timestamps, access privileges, access history, data sizes, versions, various storage settings, *etc*.
In life sciences data management, the term has been used to denote annotation information, especially manually entered information.  In many systems, the annotation information is treated differently and separately from automatically acquired data.  In DataJoint, we separate the data into the tiers *lookup*, *manual*, *imported*, and *computed* and avoid the term metadata to avoid misunderstanding.
