# Data management in Big Neuroscience
Neuroscience experiments often employ arrays of diverse recording instrumentation and incorporate myriad annotations to categorize acquired data for subsequent analyses.
The data pipeline may include manual entry of data about elements of the experiments, automated entry of data from behavior monitoring and signal acquisition systems, importing raw data from signal acquisition systems, automated preprocessing of the raw data, synchronization of signals between different modalities, and, finally, statistical analyses and summaries.

Big Neuroscience teams comprise large geographically dispersed groups of specialists with diverse backgrounds and varied levels of programming proficiency for whom database programming is never of primary interest.

Large-scale, fast-paced interinstitutional projects require principled data organization that can no longer rely on clever file naming conventions, disjoint spreadsheets, lab book notes, sticky notes, and e-mail attachments.
